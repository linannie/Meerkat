As UC Davis students, we frequently use online resources and technology for our classes. The resource we use most frequently is Smartsite, however, it has limited features. In Smartsite, there is a disconnection between the student, classmates, and professor.

The purpose of our website is to have a user-friendly interface and features that allow students to be better communicators, and be able to find all resources to work in groups.

Meerkat is an idea for a more collaborative learning site. You can view class information, chat with the professor, and upload your own resources for the class. There is a forum to promote class discussion. You can also form study groups, inviting members from your class to join you. Finally, there is a section where you can manage group projects, including a shared resource folder, chat room, and calendar of deadlines.

Here is the Resources page in an html file.
